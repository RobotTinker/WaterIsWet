# Water is Wet

This is an Exploratory Data Analysis project to see how countries around the world compare based on their
water resources, agriculture & water management and Human development. This data is gathered by [The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations](http://www.fao.org/home/en/) 
under their [AQUASTAT](http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/main/index.stm) project. 

## AQUASTAT Data

The data for this Analysis has been downloaded from the FAO's [AQUASTAT Database](http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/data/query/index.html?lang=en)

## Questions:

* How do countries compare against different parameters with respect to their population
    * Which countries are more "Urban" in terms of population? 
    * How does the % of total cultivated area in a country relate to the % rual population?
    * How does the HDI (Human Development Index) relate to % urban population

* How do countries compare w.r.t various parameters...get top n vs bottom n countries for the following:
    * Human Development Index
    * Hunger Indicator - Prevelance of undernourishment
    * Gender Inequality Index
    * GDP

* How to countries compare w.r.t water resources and agriculture
    * Available Water Resources
    * Water Use
    * Irrigation and agriculture and water harvesting

* How do countries compare w.r.t environment and health statistics
    * Access to safe drinking water
    * Floods
    * Possible water related diseases

## Plots/Visualizations

The project would result in a Flask powered website that will show the Analysis on various web pages on that website. Some of the maps can be as follows:

* Show different parameters as they relate to population on a color coded world map that allows for switching data points like (urban population, GDP, HDI, etc)
* For each/some/specific countries, show how the different parameters relate to each other. Eg. Are countries with more water resources, higher in the Human Development Index and rate higher in agriculture? This can use various charts with bars/lines/pies
