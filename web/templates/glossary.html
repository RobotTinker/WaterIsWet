    [
        ("% of Total Area Cultivated (Unit: %)", "The percentage of total area of land for a country that is cultivated for permanent and temporary crops. Land cultivated for temporary crops is called Arable land. [% of total country area cultivated] = 100*[Cultivated
        area (arable land + permanent crops)]/[Total area of the country]"),
        ("Population Density (Unit: inhab/km2)", "Number of inhabitants per square kilometre of total area."),
        ("Urban Population (Unit: 1000 inhab)", "Population residing in urban areas. Usually the urban areas and hence the urban population are defined according to national census definitions."),
        ("Rural Population (1000 inhab)", "Usually the rural population is obtained by subtracting the urban population from the total population. In practice, the criteria adopted for distinguishing between urban and rural areas vary among countries. However, these
        criteria can be roughly divided into three major groups: classification of localities of a certain size as urban; classification of administrative centres of minor civil divisions as urban; and classification of centres of minor civil divisions on a chosen
        criterion."),
        ("Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (Unit: Current UD$)", "GDP at purchaser's prices is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products. It is calculated
        without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources."),
        ("GDP per capita (Unit: Current US$/inhab)", "Gross domestic product divided by population."),
        ("Human Development Index (HDI) (Highest=1)", "This is a summary measure of human development. It measures the average achievements in a country in three basic dimensions of human development: * (1) a long and healthy life, as measured by life expectancy at
        birth; * (2) knowledge, as measured by the adult literacy rate (with two-thirds weight) and the combined primary, secondary and tertiary gross enrolment ratio (with one-third weight); * (3) a decent standard of living, as measured by GDP per capita (Purchasing
        Power Parity or PPP US$)."),
        ("Gender Inequality Index (GII) (equality=0, inequality=1)", "The Gender Inequality Index (GII) is built on the same framework as the Human Development Index (HDI) — to better expose differences in the distribution of achievements between women and men. It
        measures the human development costs of gender inequality, thus the higher the GII value the more disparities between females and males."),
        ("Prevelance of undernourishment (3-year average) (Unit: %)", "This indicator expresses the probability that a randomly selected individual from the population consumes an amount of calories that is insufficient to cover her/his energy requirement for an
        active and healthy life. This is the traditional FAO hunger indicator, adopted as official Millennium Development Goal indicator."),
        ("National Rainfall Index (NRI) (Unit: mm/year)", "The NRI yearly results take into consideration the precipitation that year, the average precipitation over the period 1986-2000, the seasonality of the main crop-growing season (distinguishing between northern
        and southern hemispheres), and what areas of the country are wetter. The median of each five year period is provided. Note: due to methodological differences, this variable is not comparable to average precipitation. "),
        ("Total Renewable Water Resources - TRWR (Unit: 10^9 m3/year)", "It corresponds to the maximum theoretical yearly amount of water available for a country at a given moment."),
        ("Total renewable water resources per capita (Unit: m3/inhab/year)", "Total annual actual renewable water resources per inhabitant."),
        ("Dependency Ratio (Unnt: %)", "Indicator expressing the percent of total renewable water resources originating outside the country. This indicator may theoretically vary between 0% and 100%. A country with a dependency ratio equal to 0% does not receive any
        water from neighbouring countries. A country with a dependency ratio equal to 100% receives all its renewable water from upstream countries, without producing any of its own."),
        ("Water Stress (Unit %)", "This parameter is an indication of the pressure on the renewable water resources. It is based on the Total freshwater withdrawn in a given year, which is expressed in percentage of the total renewable water resources (TRWR). It is
        the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) Indicator 7.5 and the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicator 6.4.2. [SDG 6.4.2. Water Stress] = 100*[Total freshwater withdrawal (primary and secondary)]/([Total renewable water resources]-[Environmental Flow
        Requirements])"),
        ("Flood Occurrence (WRI) (Value: 0-5)", "A normalized indicator of the number of floods recorded from 1985 to 2011, using the total number of floods observed in that period. The indicator was created by the World Resources Institute (WRI) and ranges from 0-5,
        where 0 is lowest and 5 is highest."),
        ("Total Population with access to safe drinking-water (JMP) (Unit: %)", "Percentage of the total population using improved water sources. An “improved” source is one that is likely to provide \"safe\" water, such as a household connection, a borehole, etc.")
