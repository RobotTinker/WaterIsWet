                <p>
                        We believe the following relationships and dependencies exist and through our analysis propose to present the relationships by exploring the data provided by <a href="http://www.fao.org/home/en/" target="_blank">The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations</a> under their <a href="http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/main/index.stm" target="_blank">AQUASTAT</a> project. 
                        <ul>
                        The development of a country depends on its water resources (rainfall, external resources, internal resources)
                        </ul>
                        <ul>
                        The development of a country depends on the rural population and production from agriculture (crops and livestock). 
                        </ul>
                        <ul>
                        The agricultural production of a country is realted to its water resources and also the amount of land cultivated.
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <b>AQUASTAT Data</b>
                        <br>
                        The data for this Analysis has been downloaded from the FAO's <a href="http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/data/query/index.html?lang=en" target="_blank"> AQUASTAT Database</a>. This database provides values of cerain parameters realted to land, population, water, development and agriculture over a few decades. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Questions:</b>
                We propose to answer the following questions for this project. The ability to answer the questions is based on the availability of these values in the data set across a selected time period. For the definition of the terms and indicators, please refer to the ```Glossary``` section provided at the end of this document.
                <br>
                1. Is GDP realted to population? Do more densly populated countries have higher GDP index? Do countries with higher rural population have a higher GDP?
                <br>
                <br>
                2. Is GDP related to the % of Total Area Cultivated? Do countries with more cultivated area have a higher GDP per capita?
                <br>
                <br>
                3. Is the HDI directly related to the urban population of the country? Do more "Urbanized" countries have higher HDI? Similarly do more urbanized countries have a lower GII?
                <br>
                <br>
                4. Do countries with higher GDP have a higher HDI? Similarty do countries with higher GDP have a lower GII?
                <br>
                <br>
                5. How is the HDI of a country related to its water resources?
                    * Do countries with a higher NRI have a higher HDI?
                    * Do countries with a lower Dependency Ratio have a higher HDI?
                    * Do countries with a higher Water Stress Indicator have a lower HDI?
                    * Do countries with a higher Flood Occurrence Indicator have a lower HDI?
                <br>
                <br>
                6. How is the GDP of a country related to its water resources?
                    * Do countries with a higher NRI have a higher GDP?
                    * Do countries with a lower Dependency Ration have a higher GDP?
                    * Do countries with a higher Water Stress Indicator have a lower GDP?
                    * Do countries with a higher Flood Occurrence Indicator have a lower GDP?
                <br>
                <br>
                7. How is the Prevelance of undernourishment related to the water resources for a country?
                    * Do countries with a lower NRI have higher Prevelance of undernourishment?
                    * Do countries with a higher Dependency Ratio have higher Prevelance of undernourishment?
                    * Do countries with a higher Water Stress Indicator have a higher Prevelance of undernourishment?
                    * Do countries with a higher Flood Occurrence Indicator have a higher Prevelance of undernourishment?
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Summary Statistics</b>
                <br>
                1. We also propose to provide a map representation of how various countries compare against each other based on certain development indicators like HDI, GDP, % total area cultivated, population density, total water resources, etc
                <br>
                <br>
                2. As part of summary statistics it would also be good to provide a tabular representation of certain indicators like HDI, GDP, % total area cultivated, population density, total water resources, etc and a way to easity determine the top 10 and bottom 10 countries for these indicators.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Technical Considerations</b>
                <br>
                <br>
                The project would result in a Flask powered website that will show the analysis on various web pages/popups on that site. The Website will be developed using HTML/CSS and Javascript libraries. The website will use the Bootstrap framework to be responsive.

                We will use a SQLite database to store and retrieve all the required data for the project.
