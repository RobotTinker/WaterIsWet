                <h4>FAO and AQUASTAT</h4>
                <p>
                        <a href="http://www.fao.org/home/en/" target="_blank">The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)</a> is specialized agency of the United Nations that leads international efforts to defeat hunger. 
                    <br><br>
                    FAO's three main goals are: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>the eradication of hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition. </li>
                        <li>the elimination of poverty and the driving forward of economic and social progress for all. </li>
                        <li>the sustainable management and utilization of natural resources, including land, water, air, climate and genetic resources for the benefit of present and future generations.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <a href="http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/main/index.stm" target="_blank">AQUASTAT</a> started, with the aim to contribute to FAO's goals through the collection, analysis and dissemination of information related to water resources, water uses and agricultural water management, with an emphasis on countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean.

                <h4>Water is Wet</h4>
                <p>
                    The amount of information provided by AQUASTAT got us intrigued and got our imagination run wild. 
                    However this data was very overwhelming at first and so we narrowed down our research to those related to the water resources, urbanization and a few others.
                    Thus was born, "Water is Wet". We looked at these parameters and tried to explore their relationship with the development indicators like 
                    Human Development Indicator (HDI), Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and "Gender Inequality Index (GII)"

                <h4>Thesis</h4>
                <p>We believed the following relationships and dependencies exist and through our analysis proposed to present the relationships by exploring the data provided by <a href="http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/main/index.stm" target="_blank">AQUASTAT</a>.

                    The data for this Analysis has been downloaded from the FAO's <a href="http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/data/query/index.html?lang=en" target="_blank"> AQUASTAT Database</a> as csv files which was imported into our database. 
                    The Aquastat database provides values of cerain parameters realted to land, population, water, development and agriculture over a few decades.

                <p>The project is a Flask powered website that shows our analysis under the Data Visualization navigation menu. 
                    The Website is developed using the following technology: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Python for the Flask application server and data retrieval</li>

                    <h4>Findings</h4>
                    <p>Through our Analysis, surprisingly, we did not find much of a correlation between the water resources and development of a country.
                        The HDI or GDP or Prevelance of undernourishment doesn't seem to have a direct dependency on National Rainfall Indicator, water dependency on other countries, 
                        Flood Occurrence, Water Stress Indicator or access to safe drinking water.
                        <br><br>
                        However we did find some interesting correlation between these parameters and the Gender Inequality Index (GII) and urbanization of countries. 
                        Take a look at our Data Visualizations for details on what we found.
