                    time period. We can see that the countries that are more urbanized have less disparity between male and female inhabitants.

                    <h4>GII vs GDP</h4>
                    This plot shows the relationship between Gender Inequality and Gross Domestic product. 
                    It is mostly consistent, with Gender Inequality dropping as GDP rises. A notable outlier is Qatar,
                    which has seen its GDP drop by roughly 20% in since 2008, but has retained relatively high gender
                    inequality, despite its GDP, which is still quite high.
