            <h4>GDP per Capita vs % Urban Population:</h4> <br>
            This plot shows the relationship of Gross Domestic Product and % of urban population of a country for a given 
            time period. We can see that the countries that are more urbanized have higher GDP per Capita.
            We also see that the GDP changes more with 50% or greater urban population.

                This plot shows the relationship of Gross Domestic Product and % of Population with access to Safe Drinking Water for a given 
                time period. We see that there is not much of a correlation between the two.

                <h4>GDP per Capita vs Dependency Ratio</h4> <br>
                This plot shows the relationship of Gross Domestic Product and the Dependency Ratio of a country for a given 
                time period. The Dependency Ratio indicates a country's dependency on other countries for its rewable water.
                A country with a dependency ratio equal to 0% does not receive any water from neighbouring countries. A country with a dependency ratio equal to 100% receives all its renewable water from upstream countries, without producing any of its own. 
                We see that there is not much of a correlation here.
